-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

Example of using LightningChart PointSeries for an interactive Bubble Chart with individual point sizes and data grouping to different colors.

The example context takes place in a setting where the relations between three performance indicators - or data properties - have to be visualized.
In this examples case, each property is mapped to X coordinate, Y coordinate and the size of the point respectively.

Furthermore, the data set is separated into three groups. This could mean for example, different products or origins of data, or other kind of classification. These groups are colored with their own unique color, and their data points can be hidden by clicking from the legend.
